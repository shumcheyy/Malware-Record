This File maintains the progress of OpenSecurityTraining's Dynamic Malware Analysis by Veronica Kovah

### We will show how to capture and record registry, file, network, mutex, API, installation, hooking and other activity undertaken by the malware.
### We will create fake network responses to deceive malware so that it shows more behavior. 
### We will also talk about how using MITRE's Malware Attribute Enumeration & Characterization (MAEC - pronounced "Mike") standard can help normalize the data obtained manually or from sandboxes, and improve junior malware analysts' reports. 
### The class will additionally discuss how to take malware attributes and turn them into useful detection signatures such as Snort network IDS rules, or YARA     signatures.


## Course Objectives:

### * Understand how to set up a protected dynamic malware analysis environment

### * Get hands on experience with various malware behavior monitoring tools

### * Learn the set of malware artifacts an analyst should gather from an analysis

### * Learn how to trick malware into exhibiting behaviors that only occur under special conditions

### * Create actionable detection signatures from malware indicators
